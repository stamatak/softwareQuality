The code expects as input a binary file (to preserve precision) containing an integer that denotes the number of sites N and then N 
per-site log likelihood values represented as doubles. This file can be generated by using the modified RAxML code in the subdirectory 
raxmlModified. To have RAxML generate this type, for instance:

./raxmlHPC-AVX -f g -m GTRGAMMA -s ../125 -z ../RAxML_parsimonyTree.INPUT_TREE -n X1

To compile the randomizer type: 

gcc randomizer.c 

to run type:

a.out 

The code expects the input file to be called binary.in 

It will then calculate the overall log likelihood (sum over all per-site log likelihoods) for 1000 random permutations 
of the addition order and print out the minimum overall log likelihood, the maximum overall log likelihood and the difference 
between  minimum and maximum.
